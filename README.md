# Shapelet Space Representation Library
`shapelet_space` is a Python library for time series analysis using shapelets. This package provides tools for shapelet discovery, dynamic time warping, and transforming time series data into shapelet space.
Basic functions for transforming short time-series into a user-defined shapelet-space representation vector. 
Longer time-series can be transformed into a matrix where each column represents the shapelet-space vector for a rolling window of subsequences.

## Installation
```bash
pip install shapelet-space
